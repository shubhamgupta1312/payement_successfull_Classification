## Overview
This project classifies online purchase orders into high-risk or low-risk categories using a Random Forest Classifier.
The solution involves data preprocessing(cleaning,wrangling,transformation), model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Files
- train_df.csv: Training dataset 
- test_df.csv: Test dataset
- Capstone_midterm_project.py: Python script containing the code
- result.txt: Output file with predicted classifications
- report.pdf: Detailed description of the solution

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary files in the working directory.
2. Run the classification_code.py script to perform data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
3. The predicted classifications will be saved in predicted_classes.txt.
4. The script will also display confusion matrices and accuracy for validation and sanity check.

## Requirements
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install the required packages using:
bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
